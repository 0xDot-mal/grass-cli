# grass-tui
A mini project that im gonna update as much as i get good in cpp.


### Using
As so there's only a pre-release right now that you can find right [here](https://github.com/0xDot-mal/grass-tui/releases/tag/v.0.0-pre.1)
which means you can also build it yourself, by cloning the repository and compiling it using whatever compiler you have in this case I'm using g++(gcc):

```github
git clone https://github.com/0xDot-mal/grass-tui.git
cd grass-tui
g++ grass-tui.cpp -o grass.exe && ./grass.exe
```

### Support for?
Support is only for windows (for now), and this absolutely doesn't mean that you cant edit or even remove anything that is windows related functions. 

### More?
If you have any ideas to make it better feel free to [post an issue](https://github.com/0xDot-mal/grass-tui/issues) this includes finding a bug.

# IMPORTANT
Only compile the files that are on the src folder anything out that folder as an example 'grass-cli.cpp' just ignore it or even delete it.
